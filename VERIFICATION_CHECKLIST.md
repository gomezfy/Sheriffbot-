```

3. **Why Verify This Bot:**
```
Sheriff Rex Bot should be verified because:

```

4. **Intent Justifications:**

```
Required for:
- Leaderboard generation (top 10 richest users)
- Profile cards showing member statistics
- Bounty system (lookup users to set/capture bounties)
- Economy features requiring member data
- Middleman trading system (verify both parties)

Without this intent, core features like leaderboards and bounties would not function.

Note: Primary interface is slash commands. Prefix commands are minimal and being phased out.
```

**Presence Intent:**
```
Required for:
- Display user online/offline status in profile cards
- Show current activity in user profiles
- Enhance visual profile features

This is optional and can be removed if required for verification.
```
