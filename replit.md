## Environment Variables

### Required Secrets (Already Configured)
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Bot authentication token
- `CLIENT_ID` - Discord application client ID
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth secret for dashboard login
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Secure session encryption key

### Optional Secrets (For Payment Processing)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API secret key
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe public key (client-side)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signature verification

### Auto-Configured by Replit
- `REPL_SLUG` - Replit project slug
- `REPL_OWNER` - Replit username
- `PORT` - Server port (5000)

## Running the Project

### Development
The project automatically runs via the configured workflow:
```bash
ts-node src/index.ts
```

This command starts both the Discord bot AND the website server on port 5000

### Deploying Slash Commands
If you add new commands or modify existing ones:
```bash
ts-node src/deploy-commands.ts
```

### TypeScript Compilation
The project uses `ts-node` for direct TypeScript execution without a build step. If you need to compile to JavaScript:
```bash
tsc
```
This will generate compiled JavaScript in the `dist/` directory according to `tsconfig.json`.

### Production Deployment
The project is configured for VM deployment (always-on) since it's a stateful Discord bot that needs to maintain persistent connections.

## Web Dashboard (LIVE)
The web dashboard is running on port 5000 and includes:

**Active Features:**
- Homepage with bot information and "Add to Discord" button
- **Shop** - Purchase backpack upgrades with Stripe checkout
  - Small Backpack (200kg) - $2.99
  - Medium Backpack (300kg) - $4.99
  - Large Backpack (400kg) - $6.99
  - Ultimate Backpack (500kg) - $9.99
- Dashboard with Discord OAuth (login required)
- User statistics and leaderboards
- Redemption code generation on purchase
- E-commerce tracking in `data/redemption-codes.json`

## Data Storage
All data is stored in JSON files in the `src/data/` directory:
- `economy.json` - User balances and transactions
- `profiles.json` - User profiles and settings
- `inventory.json` - User items and backpacks
- `bounties.json` - Active bounties
- `wanted.json` - Wanted poster configurations
- `redemption-codes.json` - Generated purchase codes

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
1. Check workflow is running (should show "RUNNING" status)
2. Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` is valid
3. Check Discord Developer Portal for intent settings
4. Review logs for connection errors
5. Run `ts-node src/deploy-commands.ts` to re-register commands

### Website Not Working
- The website is archived in `website.zip`
- See `WEBSITE_README.md` for restoration instructions

### Payment Issues (if website restored)
1. Ensure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is configured
2. Verify Stripe account is in live mode (for production)
3. Check webhook configuration matches Stripe dashboard

## Support Commands
- `/help` - View all available commands
- `/ping` - Check bot latency
- `/profile` - View your Western profile
- `/leaderboard` - See top players

## Notes
- The bot uses file-based JSON storage (not a traditional database)
- Data files are gitignored to prevent data loss during version control
- Sessions are stored in memory (will reset on server restart)
- For production, consider implementing database persistence
