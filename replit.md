## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Discord Embeds:** Uses a minimalist, neutral color palette for clean and modern embeds.
- **Visuals:** Generates professional visual leaderboards and profile cards using Canvas, featuring custom fonts, avatar borders, and gradients.
- **Custom Emojis:** Integrates 47 custom emojis to enhance the Western theme.

### Technical Implementations
- **Language & Runtime:** Built with TypeScript on Node.js 20, utilizing `ts-node`.
- **Discord Integration:** Uses `discord.js v14` for all Discord API interactions.
- **Command Structure:** Features 26 slash commands across categories like Admin, Bounty, Economy, Gambling, Mining, Profile, and Utility. Commands are organized with subcommands and subcommand groups to reduce clutter (e.g., `/bounty` with `list`, `wanted`, `capture`, `clear` subcommands, and `/admin` consolidating 11 administrative functions into subcommand groups).
- **Economy System:** Implements a dual economy with "Saloon Tokens" and "Silver Coins."
- **Upgrades & Redemption:** Includes progressive backpack upgrades and a system for redeeming website purchase codes.
- **Image Generation:** Employs `@napi-rs/canvas` for dynamic image rendering.
- **Localization:** Supports PT-BR, EN-US, ES-ES, and FR (French). All commands automatically detect and respond in the user's Discord language preference.
- **Owner Commands:** Restricted commands accessible only to bot owners.
- **Territory Investment:** Allows users to invest in territories (e.g., Saloon Business, Gold Mine Shares) for passive income. The `/territories` command is fully localized in 4 languages with automatic language detection.
- **Mining Session Tracking:** Tracks active and unclaimed mining sessions server-wide.
- **Announcement System:** Advanced announcement features with previews, templates, and targeting.
- **DM Support:** Enabled for user-focused commands.
- **Multilingual Help:** `help` command is fully translated and supports automatic language detection.
- **AutoMod Integration:** Manages Discord AutoMod rules to earn the "Uses AutoMod" badge.

### Feature Specifications
- **Bounty System:** Set, view, and capture bounties with success rates and cooldowns.
- **Mining System:** Offers solo and co-op mining modes.
- **Gambling Games:** Includes Bank Robbery, Casino, Dice, and Poker.
- **PvP Duels:** A system for player-versus-player combat.
- **E-commerce Shop:** Offers in-game items and currency packs via the web dashboard.
- **Automatic Income:** Automatically distributes territory income and weekly Gold Bar rewards.
- **Profile Customization:** Users can purchase and select custom profile backgrounds.

### System Design Choices
- **File-based Storage:** All persistent data is stored in JSON files (`src/data/` or `/app/data/`). Critical: requires volume mounting at `/app/data/` for data persistence.
- **High-Performance Caching:** An in-memory cache layer significantly reduces file I/O for faster response times.
- **Modular Design:** Codebase is organized into `commands`, `data`, `events`, and `utils`.
- **Environment Variables:** Used for sensitive configuration.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Includes Discord.js v14 advanced features, command rate limiting, and Canvas optimization.

## External Dependencies
- **Discord Library:** `discord.js v14`
- **Web Framework:** `Express v5` (for the separate web dashboard)
- **Payment Processing:** `Hotmart API`
- **Canvas Rendering:** `@napi-rs/canvas`
- **Session Management:** `express-session` (for the web dashboard)
