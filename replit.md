## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Minimalist Embed System:** Uses a neutral color palette for clean and modern Discord embeds.
- **Visual Leaderboard:** Generates professional visual leaderboards using Canvas, displaying rankings, top users' images, medals, colored avatar borders, and gradients.
- **Visual Profile Cards:** Employs Canvas with the Nunito font for appealing user profiles and wanted posters.
- **Custom Emojis:** Integrates 47 custom emojis to enhance the Western theme.

### Technical Implementations
- **Language & Runtime:** Built with TypeScript on Node.js 20, using `ts-node`.
- **Discord Integration:** Leverages `discord.js v14` for Discord API interactions.
- **Command Structure:** Features 34 slash commands across various categories (Admin, Bounty, Economy, Gambling, Mining, Profile, Utility).
- **Dual Economy System:** Manages "Saloon Tokens" and "Silver Coins."
- **Progressive Backpack Upgrades:** Implements a system for backpack capacity upgrades.
- **Redemption Code System:** Allows users to redeem website shop purchase codes for in-game items.
- **Canvas Rendering:** Uses `@napi-rs/canvas` for dynamic image generation.
- **Localization:** Supports PT-BR, EN-US, and ES-ES.
- **Owner Commands:** Restricted commands for bot owners using `OWNER_ID`.
- **Separate Hosting:** Bot and web dashboard are designed for separate hosting environments.
- **Territory Investment System:** Allows users to invest in territories (e.g., Saloon Business, Gold Mine Shares) for automatic income.
- **Mining Session Tracker:** Tracks active and unclaimed mining sessions server-wide.

### Feature Specifications
- **Bounty System:** Set, view, and capture bounties with a success rate and cooldown.
- **Mining System:** Includes solo and co-op mining modes.
- **Gambling Games:** Features Bank Robbery, Casino, Dice, and Poker.
- **PvP Duels:** A system for player-versus-player combat.
- **E-commerce Shop:** Offers backpack upgrade tiers and coin packs via the web dashboard.
- **Discord Permissions:** Requires specific bot permissions including "Moderate Members."
- **Automatic Territory Income System:** Automatically distributes territory income to users.
- **Profile Customization:** Allows users to purchase and select custom profile backgrounds.
- **Advanced Announcement System:** Features preview, color presets, customization, targeting, and template system for announcements.
- **DM Support:** Enabled DM functionality for user-focused commands.
- **Multilingual Help System:** `help` command is fully translated and supports automatic language detection.

### System Design Choices
- **File-based Storage:** All persistent data is stored in JSON files within `src/data/` (development) or `/app/data/` (production).
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FOR VERTRA:** Data persistence requires volume mounting at `/app/data/` - see `VERTRA_VOLUME_PERSISTENTE.md`
  - Without persistent volume, all user data is lost on restart/redeploy
- **High-Performance Caching:** In-memory cache layer with automatic sync reduces file I/O by 90% for 4-5x faster response times.
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into `commands`, `data`, `events`, and `utils` directories.
- **Environment Variables:** Utilizes environment variables for sensitive data.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Includes Discord.js v14 advanced features, command rate limiting, and Canvas optimization.

## External Dependencies
- **Discord Library:** `discord.js v14`
- **Web Framework:** `Express v5` (for the separate web dashboard)
- **Payment Processing:** `Hotmart API` (for e-commerce)
- **Canvas Rendering:** `@napi-rs/canvas`
- **Session Management:** `express-session` (for the web dashboard)
